    </div>
    <div class="sections">
        <h1 id="point2">2.COMPANY DESCRIPTION</h1>
        <h3 id="point2.1">Mission, vision & values:</h3>
        <p id="point2.1.1">Mission→ Make a living with this business.</p>
        <p id="point2.1.2">Vision→ Be the best, the people know who we are. When they have a problem, they want our help.</p>
        <p id="point2.1.3">Values→  10.000€ at the beginning to build my business with little staff, while over time I will need more money to continue improving my business.</p>
        <h3 id="point2.2">Who the founders are: </h3> 
        <p>I will founder my business.</p>
        <h3 id="point2.3">Location:</h3> 
        <p>I would like to expand my business around the world, but start in Spain (my country) and later EE.UU.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sections">
        <h1 id="point3">3.INDUSTRY ANALYSIS</h1>
        <h3 id="point3.1">Which is the market for your business?</h3>
        <p>The traditional business model of a law firm is to charge established fees for various services, from a mere informative consultation (face-to-face, over the phone or by videoconference) to lengthy and specialized procedures.</p>
        <p>However, in recent years the system of paying a monthly service fee has been experiencing a lot of growth. The client hires a service pack, and calls the office when he needs advice. For the firm it is a fixed and stable income, for the client it is a known amount distributed over time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sections">
        <h1 id="point4">4.TARGET MARKET</h1>
        <h3 id="point4.1">Who is your target market?</h3>
        <p>I will separate the different services and look for where to find clients for each service.</p>
        <p>For advice on data protection, I will be able to browse the Internet to see those web pages that do not comply with the regulations. Then contact the administrator of the website to offer my services.</p>
        <p>Or at the immigration office, I could leave my card at consulates and embassies, investigate Facebook groups of residents from a country, attend events, etc.</p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="sections">
        <h1 id="point5">5.COMPETITOR ANALYSIS</h1>
        <h3 id="point5.1">Who is/are your competitors?</h3>
        <p>One way to get all your competitor information is to search the internet.</p>
        <p>I will analyze the services they offer. They may even give me ideas for my business. I'll find out your rates. If they are not available online, I can send a friend to find out some information. It is enough to pretend to be a person with a legal question and contact the firm for answers.</p>                I want to meet my competitors so that I can position my own services and stand out. I will offer more services, more comfort.
        <p>I will not fight to have the lowest price since in these types of sectors, customers associate price with quality more than in others.</p>
        <p>Cheaper service can be perceived as worse.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sections">
        <h1 id="point6">6.SWOT ANALYSIS</h1>
        <h3 id="point6.1">Do a SWOT analysis of your business</h3>
        <h4>Strengths:</h4>
        <p>Large number of services, several options to get clients, not depending on having the lowest price, a useful business for itself and I could explain my business around the world.</p>
        <h4>Weaknesses:</h4>
        <p>There is a lot of competition and it will be difficult to remove customers by not being able to convince them with the lowest price.</p>
        <h4>Opportunities:</h4>
        <p>I can always increase the business and expand it all over the world as it is a business that everyone needs.</p>
        <h4>Threats:</h4>
        <p>With Covid it will be more difficult to talk face to face with customers, and the competition may take customers away.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sections">
        <h1 id="point7">7.CORPORATE CULTURE & CSR.</h1>
        <h3 id="point7.1">Define the culture and CSR of your company:</h3>
        <p>The culture of my company will be to take care of my workers with job improvements, to be a great family together, if one has a problem that he can tell me without fear and support each other, we will treat clients with respect so that feel comfortable, like family, feel safe and can tell us everything without fear.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sections">
        <h1 id="point8">8.LEGAL PERSONALITY</h1>
        <h3 id="point8.1"> Name of legal structure:</h3>
        <p>In forming a corporation, prospective shareholders exchange money, property, or both, for the corporation's capital stock. A corporation generally takes the same deductions as a sole proprietorship to figure its taxable income. A corporation can also take special deductions. For federal income tax purposes, a C corporation is recognized as a separate taxpaying entity.</p>
        <p>A corporation conducts business, realizes net income or loss, pays taxes and distributes profits to shareholders.</p>
        <p>The profit of a corporation is taxed to the corporation when earned, and then is taxed to the shareholders when distributed as dividends. This creates a double tax. The corporation does not get a tax deduction when it distributes dividends to shareholders. Shareholders cannot deduct any loss of the corporation.</p>
        <h3 id="point8.2">Partners:</h3>
        <p>We will need partners because to start a business you need to make money and with partners it will be easier and faster.</p>
        <p>We could win partners with security business or other business as a corporation.</p>
        <h3 id="point8.3">Minimum capital investment:</h3>
        <p>Opening an office is not very expensive. You only need a small room, some furniture and some computer equipment. You can even start with practically no investment, if you choose to rent an office in a coworking.</p>
        <p>With a two-month deposit, the purchase of three desks and three professional chairs, some cabinets, chairs for the reception, a couple of computers and a printer, and some decoration, the investment can cost around € 10,000 for a small office.</p>
        <p>In the 2012 study, an average turnover of € 70,000 per office was calculated, which if we speak in terms of sales per person would be about € 50,000 per office. That average amount has undoubtedly grown since then, and we can estimate it around € 60,000.</p>
        <p>With the previous estimate we can estimate a medium-term turnover of € 100,000 per year.</p>
        <p>With these assumptions, the estimated profitability for the firm with two lawyers would be € 44,000.</p>
        <h3 id="point8.4">Type of liability:</h3>
        <p>Contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are liabilities that may occur, depending on the outcome of a future event. Therefore, contingent liabilities are potential liabilities. For example, when a company is facing a lawsuit of $100,000, the company would incur a liability if the lawsuit proves successful. However, if the lawsuit is not successful, then no liability would arise. In accounting standards, a contingent liability is only recorded if the liability is probable (defined as more than 50% likely to happen) and the amount of the resulting liability can be reasonably estimated.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sections">
        <h1 id="point9">9.ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE COMPANY</h1>
        <p>Me → Receptionists, lawyers and accountants.</p>
        <p>As it is my business, I will be able to order everyone, lawyers, receptionists and accountants.</p>
        <p>Receptionists will speak with clients and arrange an appointment for them to obtain an attorney. They will also obtain various information so that we can contact the clients and find out which department their case belongs to.</p>
        <p>The accountants will be the ones to calculate the prices taking into account the hours, difficulty, priority and so on. These prices will then be passed on to the lawyers so that they can provide them to their clients.</p>
        <p>The lawyers will talk to the clients to obtain the details of their problems and prepare a solution for their situation.</p>
